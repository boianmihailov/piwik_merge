Description:
Script to import data from one Piwik installation into another.
This version works with Piwik version 1.8.3, probably there will be database structure changes in later versions.
You should run this script in the shell with `php piwik_merge.php` since it could run very long.
If the imported data doesn't show in Piwik, make sure that the created date of the site is not after the first (imported) visit.

Important notice:
I've written this script because I needed to merge two Piwik installations.
It worked for me and this task, but maybe it won't work for you.
The script is just quick work and may contain bugs or security issues.
I just wanted to share this script in case it could help somebody.

Its also important to make sure that timestamp for your new piwik site is set correctly to display imported stats.
